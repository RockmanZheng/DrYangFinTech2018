Financial Technology Project Directed by Dr. Yang, 2018

I joined this project in the spring of 2018. There are roughly 8 members taking part in this project. All 
of them are undergraduate but from different disciplines, including math, finance, management, physics, etc. Our director, Dr. Yang, is a professional in the quantitative trading field, who had been working in Wall Street and Hong Kong for over 2 decades.

Our main purpose here is to *learn* the basic technology of quantitative trading.

The automated trading system used in this project is protected by copy rights and licensed by Dr. Yang. So this GitHub repository's function is not publishing the entire project to the public. It is only for recording purpose. Moreover, it is mainly used as a host for my personal codings and loggings, and not for others'. So you will not see many of other members' works in this repository (at least directly).

Currently we have use the index ETF 510050 in China fund market as a test bed for learning how to trade with simple double SMA strategy.
